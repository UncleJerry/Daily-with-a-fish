A project works on developing an iOS app with functions target at couple communication and setting reminders for memories. 


## Aiming of this project

1. Firstly, practice my Swift language coding and the design skills:

	The following part has been practiced:
	
	- Date class
	- Notification
	- Network request by Alamofire	
		- JSON handling 
		- Log-in and sign up (with consideration of security)
	- CollectionView
	- Database by Realm

2. Cooperate with ex-girlfriend who was major in art design.
