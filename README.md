# Daily-with-a-fish

An iOS app for couple communication, chatting and setting reminders for anniversary. 


## Aiming of this project

1. Firstly, practice my Swift language coding and the design skills:

	The following concepts have been practiced:
	
	- Date class
	- Notification
	- Network request by Alamofire	
		- JSON handling 
		- Log-in and sign up (with consideration of security)
	- CollectionView
	- Database (Realm)

2. Cooperate with ex-girlfriend who was major in art design.
	She responded for drawing the icon (under my command and supervision )
